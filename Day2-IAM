Hello! Welcome to Day 2 of our AWS Zero to Hero series. In our previous session, we covered the basics of cloud computing, private vs. public clouds, and why AWS is a leading cloud provider. Today, we're diving into a crucial AWS service: IAM (Identity and Access Management).

What is AWS IAM and Why Do We Need It?
Think of a bank. Not everyone can just walk in and access the vault, right? You first need to be an authenticated person (like having an account with the bank). Once inside, your access is authorized based on who you are (e.g., a customer can go to the service desk, but an employee might access the employee desk, and only specific, highly authorized personnel can access sensitive areas like the vault).

Similarly, in AWS, your account might have many services (like computing, databases, storage). If everyone in your company had the "root" access (the highest level of access you get when you first create an AWS account), they could accidentally or intentionally delete critical information, leading to huge problems for your application.

AWS IAM is the service that solves this problem. It handles authentication (verifying who you are) and authorization (determining what you can do).

Core Components of AWS IAM
IAM has four main components that help manage access:

Users:

An IAM User represents a person or application that needs to interact with AWS.
When someone joins your company and needs AWS access, you create a unique IAM user for them.
This user will have their own login credentials (username and password) to access the AWS Management Console or programmatic access (like through the command line).
Important: The "root user" of your AWS account has unrestricted access. It's a best practice to never use the root user for daily tasks. Instead, create specific IAM users, even for administrators, to maintain control and accountability.
Policies:

A Policy is a document that defines permissions. It specifies what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources.
When you create an IAM user, you attach policies to that user. Without a policy, a user can log in but cannot do anything in AWS (like our bank example, they can enter but can't perform any actions).
AWS provides many pre-defined policies called AWS Managed Policies (e.g., "AmazonS3FullAccess" which grants full control over S3 storage).
You can also create Custom Policies if the AWS managed policies don't fit your exact needs (these are usually written in a JSON format and define the "Effect" (allow/deny), "Action" (what services/actions), and "Resource" (which specific resources)).
Groups:

An IAM Group is a collection of IAM users.
Groups are used to make managing permissions much more efficient. Instead of attaching the same policies to individual users one by one, you create a group (e.g., "Developers," "QA Engineers," "DB Admins"), attach policies to the group, and then add users to that group.
All users within a group automatically inherit the permissions attached to that group.
This is especially helpful when people frequently join or leave the organization, or when a whole team needs new permissions. You just update the group's policy once, and all members instantly get the updated permissions.
Roles:

IAM Roles are similar to users, but they are not associated with a specific person. Instead, they are designed to be assumed by AWS services, applications running on AWS, or even users from other AWS accounts.
Roles provide temporary security credentials and are ideal for situations where you don't want to manage permanent credentials for an application or service.
For example, an application running on an EC2 instance might assume a role to access a database without storing database credentials directly on the instance.
We will explore roles in more detail in future, more advanced sessions, especially when integrating different AWS services or external tools.
Practical Steps to Try Yourself
Let's walk through what you can do to understand these concepts hands-on:

Log in as the Root User: Use the root email address and password you set up on Day 1 to log into your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to IAM: Search for "IAM" in the AWS console search bar and go to the IAM dashboard.
Create an IAM User:
Go to "Users" and click "Add users."
Give your user a name (e.g., "test-user-501").
Choose "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console."
Select "I want to create an IAM user" and "Auto-generated password."
Make sure "Users must create a new password at next sign-in" is checked.
Crucially, for the first attempt, do NOT attach any permissions/policies yet. Just create the user.
Download the .csv file with the user's credentials and sign-in URL.
Test the User (Without Permissions):
Log out of your root account.
Log in as the IAM user you just created, using the console sign-in URL, username, and the auto-generated password (you'll be prompted to change it).
Try to access any AWS service, like S3 (storage service) or EC2 (compute service). You will see "Access Denied" errors, demonstrating that without authorization (policies), the authenticated user cannot perform any actions.
Add Permissions to the IAM User:
Log back into your root account.
Go to IAM, find your "test-user-501," and click on it.
Under the "Permissions" tab, click "Add permissions."
Choose "Attach policies directly."
Search for and select "AmazonS3FullAccess" (an AWS managed policy).
Review and add the permissions.
Test the User (With Permissions):
Log out of your root account again and log in as your "test-user-501."
Now, navigate to the S3 service. You should be able to see existing S3 buckets (if any) and even create new ones, confirming that the policy has granted authorization.
Create an IAM Group and Assign Permissions:
Log back into your root account.
Go to IAM, then "User Groups," and click "Create group."
Name your group (e.g., "Development-Group").
Attach the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy to this group during creation.
After creating the group, go into the group details, and under the "Users" tab, click "Add users." Add your "test-user-501" to this group.
Now, try logging in as "test-user-501" again. You'll still have S3 full access, but this time, the permissions are inherited from the group, not directly attached to the user.
Assignment: Try adding another policy to the "Development-Group" (e.g., "AmazonEC2FullAccess"). Then, log in as "test-user-501" and verify that you now have access to EC2 services as well, demonstrating the efficiency of groups!
This hands-on practice will solidify your understanding of IAM users, policies, and groups. Remember to always use IAM users instead of the root account for your work!
