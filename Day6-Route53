What is AWS Route 53?

Route 53 provides DNS (Domain Name System) as a service on AWS.
Just like EC2 provides compute as a service, and EKS provides Kubernetes as a service, Route 53 offers DNS as a service.
What is DNS and Why is it Needed?

DNS stands for Domain Name System.
It's used daily when accessing websites like amazon.com or flipkart.com.
When applications or load balancers are created on AWS, they are assigned IP addresses.
However, users don't use IP addresses (e.g., 3.6.10.171) because they are difficult to remember and can change dynamically.
DNS maps domain names to IP addresses or resolves domain names to IP addresses.
In real-world scenarios, DNS typically resolves a domain name to a load balancer's IP address.
How Route 53 Fits into AWS Architecture

When a user tries to access an application via a domain name (e.g., amazon.com), Route 53 intercepts the request.
Route 53 then checks its DNS records to resolve the domain name to the load balancer's IP address, and from there, the request proceeds to the application.
Key Components of Route 53:

Domain Registration:
You can purchase domain names directly from AWS through Route 53.
Alternatively, you can integrate domain names purchased from other sellers (e.g., GoDaddy) with Route 53.
Domain registration involves an upfront payment to AWS.
Hosted Zones:
Whether you buy the domain from AWS or elsewhere, you need to create hosted zones.
Hosted zones are where you create and maintain DNS records, which map domain names to IP addresses.
Route 53 uses these records to resolve DNS names to IP addresses when requests come in.
Health Checks:
Route 53 can perform health checks on web applications or servers.
It can periodically send requests to servers to monitor their active status.
This allows Route 53 to forward requests only to active and healthy web servers, potentially performing some balancing.
The video concludes by mentioning that the next session will involve a practical project to implement a public/private subnet architecture using VPC components and Route 53.
