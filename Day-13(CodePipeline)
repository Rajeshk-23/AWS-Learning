AWS Zero to Hero Series - Day 13: AWS Code Pipeline

The topic for today is AWS Code Pipeline, part of the AWS CI/CD services.
The four major AWS services for CI/CD are: AWS Code Commit, AWS Code Pipeline, AWS Code Build, and AWS Code Deploy. These will be covered in four separate videos with a full demonstration later.
Today's video compares AWS Code Pipeline with Jenkins, a popular open-source CI platform, to help viewers correlate the concepts.
A demonstration of using all AWS services for an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline will be done in future videos.
CI/CD Workflow with Jenkins (Open Source):

Jenkins is an open-source platform widely used for CI/CD.
Workflow:
A developer makes a code commit to a source code repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab).
A webhook from the repository (e.g., GitHub webhook) triggers a Jenkins pipeline.
The Jenkins pipeline (written in Groovy scripting, declarative or scripted) implements continuous integration (CI) and invokes continuous delivery (CD).
Continuous Integration (CI) Stages:
Code checkout
Build and unit tests (stages vary by organization)
Static code analysis (SAST, DAST using tools like SonarQube)
Docker image creation
Docker image scanning
Docker image push
Continuous Delivery (CD) Invocation: After CI, Jenkins can invoke the CD process.
Older methods: Ansible, shell scripts.
Recommended method: GitOps platforms like Argo CD, Flux CD, or Spinnaker for deploying to Kubernetes clusters. GitOps ensures constant reconciliation and single source of truth.
Jenkins acts as an orchestrator for CI, and facilitates or invokes CD.
CI/CD Workflow with AWS Code Pipeline (AWS Managed):

The goal is to move the entire CI/CD ecosystem to AWS managed services.

Workflow:

A user makes a code change to AWS Code Commit (AWS's managed Version Control System, comparable to GitHub/GitLab).
AWS Code Commit triggers an AWS Code Pipeline.
AWS Code Pipeline acts as the orchestrator, similar to Jenkins.
AWS Code Pipeline invokes Continuous Integration using AWS Code Build.
Code Build is responsible for all the CI stages (build, test, image creation, etc.). While scripts can be used, Code Build is the common approach.
AWS Code Pipeline invokes Continuous Delivery using AWS Code Deploy.
Code Deploy handles the CD part, deploying to target platforms like Kubernetes, EC2 instances, or ECS.
Comparison: Jenkins vs. AWS Code Pipeline (Open Source vs. AWS Managed):

Why AWS Code Pipeline is used (despite being chargeable):
Managed Service: AWS handles all management, scaling, security patches, health checks, and resource allocation.
Reduced Management Overhead: Companies, especially startups or small companies, don't need dedicated DevOps engineers to manage CI/CD infrastructure (like Jenkins masters and worker nodes/slaves).
Pay-as-you-go: Users only pay for what they use.
Why Jenkins is often preferred (despite management overhead):
Open Source & Free: The open-source version is free, reducing cost.
Management Efficiency: Efficient DevOps engineers can manage Jenkins effectively, especially with Docker agents that spin up and down with pipeline runs, optimizing infrastructure.
AWS Tools for Jenkins Management: Jenkins can be deployed on AWS EC2 instances with Auto Scaling Groups, CloudWatch, and alarms, allowing AWS to manage the underlying infrastructure for Jenkins.
Platform Agnostic: This is a major advantage. Jenkins pipelines are not restricted to AWS. If an organization moves to Azure, Google Cloud, or on-premises, Jenkins pipelines can be easily migrated and reused.
Vendor Lock-in: AWS Code Pipeline creates vendor lock-in; pipelines written for AWS Code Pipeline will only work within AWS.
Features & Integrations: Jenkins generally offers more features and can integrate with a wider range of tools compared to AWS Code Pipeline.

Conclusion:

Jenkins is popular due to its features, integrations, and platform independence.
AWS Code Pipeline is chosen when organizations want everything fully managed by AWS and cost is not a barrier.
Learning AWS managed CI/CD services like Code Pipeline is still valuable, as some organizations operate entirely within the AWS ecosystem.
The next video will demonstrate continuous integration using GitHub, AWS Code Pipeline, and AWS Code Build. The video after that will complete the end-to-end CI/CD.
